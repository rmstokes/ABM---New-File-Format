Updated File Format

This is a software biometric mechanism that may be integrated as a backend component for usage in active authentication.
Text files that contain the mouse movments of users are collected on the front end and the code in this repo will parse
those text files in order to create profiles for each user. Based on the mouse movements stored within a user profile, we are 
able to verify is a current user is who they say they are or if there may be an imposter logged into their account.

The code that is written here has been generated in collaboration with a team of researchers at North Carolina A&T State 
University (Robert Stokes, Kelvin Bryant, Angelica Willis, Zanetta Tyler, and Anthony Dobson).
